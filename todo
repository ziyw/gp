- What is the objective function for GP
- Marginal likelihood (how to get the optimize of the parameters)

- No need to add the white noise kernel in the rbf regression
because we could add another kernel to the rbf regression model 

- Add white noise kernel

- replace the set_kernels with "="

- Get GPy return marginal likelihood

- Bayesian optimization with GP is more like to use GP to solve bayesian optimization problem rather than to optimize parameters for GP 

- Keep the calculation of Kernel in the GP part? or still make in the Kernel object? if keep it in the kernel, could we optimize it?

- Make the structure of the repo better, according to Hitchhack's guide to python
